# BF-UV21R-inside

Scans of the Baofeng UV-21R V2 main PCB.

There is currently (as of 2023-12-18) [no CHiRP support](https://chirp.danplanet.com/issues/10581).
I would not recommend buying this device.

See [ZdenekBrichacek/PCB-2way_Radio-AT1846](https://github.com/ZdenekBrichacek/PCB-2way_Radio-AT1846) for datasheet and programming manual to the _RDA1846_.
